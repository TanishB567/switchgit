# switchgit
For switching between multiple GitHub accounts on your MacBook

Steps:
- Download [switch_git_profile.sh](switch_git_profile.sh), edit your details into it.
- Run ```chmod +x switch_git_profile.sh``` in your terminal
- Run ```alias switchgit='INSERTPATH/switch_git_profile.sh'``` in your terminal

Now, `switchgit personal` and `switchgit work` can be used to alternate between your GitHub accounts!
